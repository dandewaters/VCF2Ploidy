# VCF2Ploidy

## Introduction
This R package acts as a companion package to the [gbs2ploidy package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbs2ploidy/index.html). The functions in the GBS2Ploidy package require the input data to be in Heterozygous Allele Depth (HAD) format, but does not include a function for converting from Variant-Calling Format (VCF). The VCF2HAD() function in this package reads in VCF files and returns a data frame in HAD format hat can be input to the GBS2Ploidy functions. Alternatively, you can use the VCF2Ploidy() function in this package to achieve this in one step.
